# PC104GUS

This is just a PC104plus board for the picogus.
All credit for this remains with the original picogus project and not me, I just rerouted the board to fit my PC104+ computer.

The PCI connector is not connected and is not needed, it is there so that should I get any PCI cards in the future I can use them on my system
