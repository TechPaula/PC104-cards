# PC104+ Proto card

This is PC104+ Protoboard, with power broken out and a bunch of uncommitted 0.1" spaced holes to solder dip sockets, etc too.

The PCI connector is not connected and is not needed, it is there so that should I get any PCI cards in the future I can use them on my system

## Update
2025-07-05 - Updated to revision 1.1, this is a four layer board and breaks out the J1 and J2 connectors to allow you to solder to the J1/J2 without preventing stacking. Board not yet built/tested
2025-06-22 - Board routed but NOT yet built/tested.
