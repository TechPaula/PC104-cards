# PC104 Transputer card

This is a PC104plus board that provides a connection to an INMOS C011 and on to a transputer.
This is going to form the basis of a PC104 stack of transputers.

The PCI connector is not connected and is not needed, it is there so that should I get any PCI cards in the future I can use them on my system

There isn't one, if you want to build it or adapt it, go for it.
